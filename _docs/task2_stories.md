# Task 2 - User Stories

1) Title: Containerizing the application
   Description: To ensure that each unit of code performs as expected, run unit tests. And if the unit tests pass, deploy the application to a docker container.

2) Title: Deploying on IBM Cloud
   Description: Instead of hosting on self-managed or in-house virtual machines, deploy the application on IBM Cloud, using IBM Cloud Code Engine.

3) Title: Creating a pipeline for packaging and deploying the application
   Description: The current process of packaging and deploying involves too many manual steps. Use a Tekton pipeline to automate the build, test, and packaging stages of the application.
